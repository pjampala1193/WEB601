        <p>
            The greatest cliffs are these four cliffs located in southern California.
            Each of these cliffs have their own uniqueness and beauty: West Cliff,
            North Cliff, East Cliff and South Cliff are the pride of California.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each cliff has many amenities to offer visitors such as recreational areas,
            camping sites, wildlife watch spots and overnight cabins.
        </p>

        <p>
            No matter which direction you head from Irvine, California, the sites are
            easily reached within a 100 mile radius. West Cliff is the most popular
            among Westcliff University campus students because of its close proximity.
